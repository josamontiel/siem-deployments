# Free Home SIEM

In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of SOC infrastructure, I decided to set up a simple SIEM. This has been done using a Raspberry Pi, some virtual machines (using virtual box) and Wazuh. As described on their site "Wazuh is a free and open source security platform that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities. It protects workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments." This means i was able to deploy all of this for the free!!

### Tools Used:
1. [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)
2. [Virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
3. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)

The Raspberry pi I already had and just used RaspberryPi OS. So I technically did not have to purchase anyhting for this project. The Pi was used as the Wazuh Server as I had a 256gb SD card so storage will not be an issue. I'm limited in how many VMs i can run at once as my laptop only has 8GB :(. 

## I need a Wazuh server

This is going to be the raspberry Pi, the specs are a bit low for it, but, somehow it worked. You can find the system requirements [here](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/quickstart.html)

To install this on to the raspberry pi I needed to ssh on to it and run the following command:

```curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.12/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a```

This will take quite some time, so don't be alarmed by this. Once it does complete, you will be given an address to the server, which will be something like ```https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:443```, then you will be brough to the following page:

Once logged in, we need to add an agent to begin ingesting logs. This is a pretty straightforward process and Wazuh dies a good job of streamlining it. From the main page you will see a button to add a new agent:

Once added, it will show up along with any other added machines, like the endpoint pictured above.

## Endpoint Added

Once added, we're at the main dashboard, from there, you start cooking. You can:


1. Threat Hunt
2. Scan for Vulnerabilities
3. Make changes based on certain Complaince standards (NIST 800-53, GDPR etc.

### Securing our posture

One of the features that Wazuh provides is the ability to secure your security posture based on certain recommmendations. For example, my Macbook pro, which is registered in Wazuh as an endpoint, has some recomendations to raise my score. Currently it is at 59%, and there are some suggestions on how to raise my score.

One of the recommendations is to set auto updates for my apps, a very good practice for people to implement.

Once the recommendations are implemented the score will update.
