# SIEM Deployment labs

The purpose of this lab is to showcase both an on prem SIEM deployment and a cloud based SIEM Deployment.

The on prem deployment will be done using a Raspberry pi4, my macbook pro and Wazuh, a free SIEM/XDR tool.

The cloud SIEM deployment will be done using Azure Sentinel.
